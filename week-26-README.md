# Week 26
This week I have focussed on reading up on the MVC concept and implementing the MVC code structure in the project.
For everything is following the MVC concept except the 3D visualization with ThreeJs, but I will do that in the upcoming week.

Overall, I am not sure if it really makes sense to utilize MVC as a code structure pattern here because it makes the code a little more difficult to understand in my opinion.
